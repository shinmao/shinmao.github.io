Beginning of the year, still struggling in error handling and exception...

Automatic Detecting Error Handling Bugs using Error Specifications
------
The paper was published in Usenix Security 2016. Error Path Explorer (EPEx) was created to find error handling bugs in the C program.

Authors consider the lack of exception-support makes error handling bugs in C program difficult to detect. This work addressed three challenges: error path exploration, lack of an error oracle, error bug localization with under-constrained symbolic execution. If program doesn't follow three rules: propagating correct error value, stop execution, logging to handle the error, then EPEx would mark it as potential bug.

What is error specification? it means how data used to indicate error and non-error. For example, the function return negative integer to show that some error happens in it. This paper assumes manually created per-function error specification was given.

From my understanding, to define incorrect error handling is the most difficult part to find such type of bug. To achieve it, this work combines the error specification and default behaviors based on observation.
