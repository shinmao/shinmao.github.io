Hung-Mao (Rafael) Chen is currently pursuing a Ph.D. in [Sun Security Lab](https://sunlab-gmu.github.io/) at George Mason University, where his research focuses on automating the detection and repair of security vulnerabilities in the Rust ecosystem. He has significant experience in static analysis, reverse engineering, and vulnerability detection. Rafael has been instrumental in developing tools to detect type confusion bugs, which has led to the discovery of over 100 zero-day vulnerabilities in critical Rust packages. His work has been recognized through multiple RUSTSEC and CVE IDs. His technical proficiency spans languages such as Rust, C/C++, Python, and more, with expertise in frameworks like PyTorch, PySpark, and Docker, allowing him to design and implement robust security solutions. In addition to his academic work, Rafael has completed internships that solidified his practical skills. At [Certik](https://www.certik.com/), he developed a static analysis tool in detecting integer vulnerabilities of benchmark dataset in cross-chain ecosystems. During his internship at [Vector35](https://vector35.com/), he built [AlgoProphet](https://github.com/Vector35/AlgoProphet), a Binary Ninja plugin capable of reverse-engineering complex arithmetic algorithms across different architectures, showcasing his expertise in security research and system analysis.
