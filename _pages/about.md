I am Rafael. Currently, I am studying as 2nd PhD student in Information Security. I have research interest in vulnerability discovery and binary analysis. I love to take things into practice, so I would play some real-world bug hunting or PWN in CTF in rest of my time. Welcome to contact me if you find some interesting projects in following.

egalito-reversePatch
------
This is a open-source project which can be found on [github](https://github.com/shinmao/egalito-reversePatch), and the original project of egalito can be found [here](https://github.com/columbia/egalito). egalito-reversePatch leaverages the interesting design of egalito IR and makes some **binary code similarity** works with clustering methods. However, the most amazing power of egalito IR is that it makes static binary instrumentation and relocation easier. Thanks for the support from authors and @Anthony in Columbia, I have realized that IR can be designed for different purpose, which has a big impact on my research in the future. The main code of my work can be found in [pass/reversepatch.cpp](https://github.com/shinmao/egalito-reversePatch/blob/main/src/pass/reversepatch.cpp), and it would extract the tokens as training features while visiting each instruction (It only worked on arch `x86_64` at this time).
