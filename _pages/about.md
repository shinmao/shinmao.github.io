Hung-Mao (Rafael) Chen is currently pursuing a Ph.D. in [Sun Security Lab](https://sunlab-gmu.github.io/) at George Mason University, where his research focuses on automating the detection and repair of security vulnerabilities in the Rust ecosystem. He has significant experience in static analysis, reverse engineering, and vulnerability detection. Rafael has been instrumental in developing an automatic tool to detect type confusion bugs, which has led to the discovery of over 100 zero-day vulnerabilities in critical Rust packages. His work has been recognized through multiple RUSTSEC and CVE IDs.
